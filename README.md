# 📘 Smart Calculator (C# Console App)
> A console calculator developed in C#, allowing you to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The program uses methods, switch-case, TryParse for data validation, and maintains a main loop until the user decides to exit.
## 🚀 Features

➕ Addition
➖ Subtraction

✖️ Multiplication

➗ Division (with division by zero prevention)

✔️ Numeric input validation (TryParse)

🔁 Executes multiple operations until the user exits

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET SDK 9+
